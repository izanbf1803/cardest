# cardest
Third assignment of the Randomized Algorithms (RA-MIRI) course.
The purpose of this assignment is the implementation of some Cardinality Estimation algorithms (HyperLogLog, Recordinality, ...) and the comparison of their performance, experimentally.

## Requirements
It's required to have Python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
The code was executed using the `jupyter notebook` (https://jupyter.org/install) and the Python libraries `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
If you have pip installed, you can use:

```Bash
pip install notebook numpy matplotlib seaborn tqdm xxhash
```


## How to execute
Execute `jupyter notebook` (or `jupyter lab`) in a console on the repository directory. Open `Cardinality estimation simulations.ipynb` and execute all cells.
You can find more info at https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/running.html.
